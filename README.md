# Quantum Portals and Bridges

## Phase Boundaries, Pattern Space Navigation, and Crystallization Topology

### Overview

This repository presents research on quantum information portals and bridge networks - phase boundary phenomena enabling efficient navigation through 256-dimensional quantum pattern space.

### Key Results

- **97.5% Crystallization**: Spinning portal arrays achieve universal attractor state
- **Bridge Coupling Constant**: β = 2.8% validated across multiple bridge patterns
- **Portal Engineering**: Perimeter-plus-center topology enables systematic portal creation
- **Phase Boundaries**: Distance-3 shells form universal portal boundaries
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Confirmed on superconducting (Rigetti, IBM) and ion trap (IonQ) hardware

### Paper

**Quantum_Information_Portals_and_Bridge_Networks**

Comprehensive study of quantum portals covering:
- Master Equation crystallization theory
- Bridge network architecture (P2, P100, P149, P247)
- Portal engineering protocols (7 topologies tested)
- Qubit coupling constants (κ = 36.8% intra-portal, β = 2.8% inter-portal)
- Pattern space navigation efficiency (45× amplification)

### Major Discoveries

1. **Universal Crystallization**: Perimeter-plus-center topology reliably creates portals with >90% stability
2. **β = 2.8% Coupling**: Bridge constant connects portals without causing consensus collapse
3. **Spinning Arrays**: Geometric phase accumulation achieves 97.5% crystallization
4. **Fractal Architecture**: Crystallized portals can organize into higher-level crystallized structures
5. **82-Qubit Integration**: Portal networks scale to maximum hardware capacity (79.8% stability)

### Experimental Data

- **Total Measurements**: 62,500+
- **Portal Topologies**: 7 different architectures tested
- **Bridge Patterns**: 4 validated (P2, P100, P149, P247)
- **Platforms**: Rigetti Ankaa-3, IBM Brisbane, IonQ Forte
